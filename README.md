# Draughts

This is a [Processing](http://processing.org) library that lets you treat your
drawing commands - `pushMatrix`, `translate`, `rect`, etc - as objects, which
(theoretically) should let you shuffle them, randomize them, etc, before
they're drawn.

It's not yet clear whether this will be useful.

The name is a pun on the English word "draught," which comes from the Old
English word "dragan," meaning "carry, pull." It gave us the modern word
"draft," which is both a drawing (e.g. an architectural sketch, a dragging of a
pencil across paper), and a verb, meaning "to pull" or "to draw." Since this
project is about turning verbs into nouns, it seemed close enough for a working
title.
